# Modify this file to change the class structure.
#
# Classes in Magic are used to group player data together. Players may learn spells
# or gain mana or other attributes within a specific class, rather than globally.
#
# Wands may also uses classes to determine where to store their data, if not stored
# on the wand itself.
#
# Classes may be unlocked, meaning a player will automatically be put in that class
# should they use a wand of that class. Or a class may be locked, meaning a player must
# be added to a class (unlocking it for them) before they may use any wands of that class.
#
# A class may refer to a progression path (paths.yml) via path_start. This will allow the class to progress
# as defined by that path.
#
# You can add new classes in this file or modify the builtin ones. Use load_default_classes: false
# in config.yml to remove the default classes completely.
#
# You can also add individual files to the classes/ folder
#
# To see the current default builtin configs, look in this folder:
