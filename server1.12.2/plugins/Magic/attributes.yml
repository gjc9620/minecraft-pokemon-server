# Modify this file to add or remove attributes.
#
# Attributes in Magic are properties assigned to players that can be added to over time.
#
# These properties can be used to improve or modify spell behaviors as a player progresses.
#
# You can add new attributes in this file or modify the builtin ones. Use load_default_attributes: false
# in config.yml to remove the default attributes completely.
#
# You can also add individual files to the attributes/ folder
#
# To see the current default builtin configs, look in this folder:
